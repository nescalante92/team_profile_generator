# team_profile_generator

## Description

The objective is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

-------------------

## User Story

As A manager, I would like to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic information in order for me to have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

-----------------------

## Acceptance Criteria


- When I am prompted with my team member's information, then an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input.

- When I click on an email address in the HTML, then my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address.

- When I click on the GitHub username, then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab.

- When I start the application, then I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number.

- When I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, then I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team.

- When I select the engineer option, then I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu.

- When I select the intern option, then I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu.

- When I decide to finish building my team, then I exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
